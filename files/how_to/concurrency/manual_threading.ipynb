    "# Set up Manual Threading\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling threading in Panel like we saw in the [automatic threading guide](threading) is a simple way to achieve concurrency, however sometimes we need more control. Below we will demonstrate an example of a `Thread` which we start in the background to process items we put in a queue for processing. We simulate the processing with a `time.sleep` but it could be any long-running computation. The `threading.Condition` allows us to manipulate the global shared `queue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "c = threading.Condition()\n",
    "\n",
    "button = pn.widgets.Button(name='Click to launch')\n",
    "text = pn.widgets.StaticText()\n",
    "\n",
    "queue = []\n",
    "\n",
    "def callback():\n",
    "    global queue\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        c.acquire()\n",
    "        for i, event in enumerate(queue):\n",
    "            text.value = f'Processing item {i+1} of {len(queue)} items in queue.'\n",
    "            ... # Do something with the event\n",
    "            time.sleep(2)\n",
    "        queue.clear()\n",
    "        text.value = \"Queue empty\"\n",
    "        c.release()\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "thread = threading.Thread(target=callback)\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will create a callback that puts new items for processing on the queue when a button is clicked:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def on_click(event):\n",
    "    queue.append(event)\n",
    "\n",
    "button.on_click(on_click)\n",
    "\n",
    "pn.Row(button, text).servable()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the processing happens on a separate thread the application itself can still remain responsive to further user input (such as putting new items on the queue).\n"
