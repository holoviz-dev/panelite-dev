    "First, you need to set up your Google cloud account following the [Cloud Run documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/python) or the [App Engine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/quickstart) depending on whether you would like to deploy your Panel app to Cloud Run or App Engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will need three files:\n",
    "1. app.py: This is the Python file that creates the Panel App.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. requirements.txt: This file lists all the package dependencies of our Panel app. Here is an example for requirements.txt:\n",

    "3. app.yml (for App Engine) or Dockerfile (for Cloud Run)\n",

    "Here is an example for app.yml (if you would like to deploy to App Engine):\n",
    "```\n",

    "# Use the official lightweight Python image.\n",
    "# https://hub.docker.com/_/python\n",

    "Finally, to deploy a Panel app to App Engine run `gcloud app create` and `gcloud app deploy`. To deploy a Panel app to Cloud Run, run `gcloud run deploy`.\n",
