    "# Automatically Cache\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide addresses how to use the `panel.cache` decorator to memoize (i.e. cache the output of) functions automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pn.cache` decorator provides an easy way to cache the outputs of a function depending on its inputs (i.e. `memoize`). If you've ever used the Python `@lru_cache` decorator you will be familiar with this concept. However the `pn.cache` functions supports additional cache `policy`'s apart from LRU (least-recently used), including `LFU` (least-frequently-used) and 'FIFO' (first-in-first-out). This means that if the specified number of `max_items` is reached Panel will automatically evict items from the cache based on this `policy`. Additionally items can be deleted from the cache based on a `ttl` (time-to-live) value given in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caching in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pn.cache` decorator can easily be combined with the different Panel APIs including `pn.bind` and `pn.depends` providing a powerful way to speed up your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@pn.cache(max_items=10, policy='LRU')\n",
    "def load_data(path):\n",
    "    return ... # Load some data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have decorated your function with `pn.cache` any call to `load_data` will be cached in memory until `max_items` value is reached (i.e. you have loaded 10 different `path` values). At that point the `policy` will determine which item is evicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pn.cache` decorator can easily be combined with `pn.bind` to speed up rendering of your reactive components:\n",

    "\n",
    "If you have `diskcache` installed you can also cache the results to disk by setting `to_disk=True`.
